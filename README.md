Overview of the project

Project:SIMPLE RESTFUL API image

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this project is to create a simple RESTful API for managing user data. The API allows users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on user records. This project provides hands-on experience in building and managing APIs using Express.js, and it demonstrates the principles of RESTful architecture.

KEY ACTIVITIES: 1.Project Setup Initialize a new Node.js project. Install Express.js using npm.

2.Basic Configuration Set up the Express application and configure it to parse JSON request bodies.

3.Data Structure Create a sample in-memory data structure (array) to store user records.

4.Implementing API Endpoints GET /users: Retrieve a list of all users. GET /users/ : Retrieve a single user by their ID. POST /users: Create a new user with specified attributes (name, age). PUT /users/ : Update an existing user's information based on their ID. DELETE /users/ : Remove a user from the collection by their ID.

5.Error Handling Implement error handling for scenarios such as user not found (404 status) and validation of request data.

6.Testing the API Use Postman or curl to send requests to the API and verify responses for each endpoint. Test for successful operations as well as error scenarios.

7.Documentation Write basic documentation for the API endpoints, including expected inputs and outputs, to help future developers understand how to use the API.

TECHNOLOGIES USED: .Programming Language: JavaScript (Node.js) .Framework: Express.js .Data Storage: In-memory array (for simplicity) .Development Tools:

Postman or curl for testing the API Code editor (e.g., Visual Studio Code) Node.js environment for running the server
